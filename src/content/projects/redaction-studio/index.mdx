<Section title="Overview">
Axon Redaction is a mission-critical tool used by public safety agencies to redact sensitive information from digital evidence. 
Across two years, I led the end-to-end design of a major transformation across these phases:

- **2024 — Redaction 2.0:** Speed, accuracy, and intuitive UX  
- **2025 — AI Expansion:** New AI models and scalable automation patterns  
- **2026 — Axon Evidence Redesign:** Unified system design for multi-modal redaction  

This case study provides a concise overview of the work.  
In interviews, I share the full research insights, prototypes, and testing videos.

<Section title="My Role">
As **Lead Product Designer**, I shaped the product's multi-year vision and delivered core functionality across AI, workflows, and user experience.

My responsibilities included:
- UX strategy and roadmap alignment  
- Research synthesis (50+ interviews & usability tests)  
- Interaction design for AI-assisted workflows  
- Prototyping and iterative validation with agencies  
- Redesign of the app on new Axon Evidence platform

This work required deep collaboration with PM, engineering, and research partners.

**Focus:** Dramatically reduce time-to-redact while improving accuracy and usability.

**What I designed:**
- **Bulk Redaction:** Run AI across dozens of videos simultaneously  
- **Face Grouping via Thumbnails:** Reduce timeline clutter and cognitive load  
- **Improved object tracking & editing tools**  
- **Streamlined UI:** Undo/redo, keyboard shortcuts, clearer hierarchy  

**Impact:**  
Agencies went from 4× video length to a 70% faster workflow.

**Focus:** Support the most time-consuming manual redaction tasks with AI assistance.

**What I designed:**
- **Model-agnostic detection framework** for expanding AI capabilities  
- Support for **notebooks, handwriting, ID cards, mobile screens**  
- Full redesign of **Audio PII redaction**, improving:  
  - Discoverability  
  - Inline editing  
  - Transparency between AI and manual redactions  

**Impact:**  
Enabled a scalable, multi-modal redaction experience across video, audio, and images.
