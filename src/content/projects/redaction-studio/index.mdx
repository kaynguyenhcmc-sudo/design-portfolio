title: "Redaction App — Multi-Year AI-Driven Redesign"
role: "Lead Product Designer"
timeline: "2024–2026"

<Section title="Overview">
Axon Redaction is a mission-critical tool used by public safety agencies to redact sensitive information from digital evidence. 
Across two years, I led the end-to-end design of a major transformation across these phases:

- **2024 — Redaction 2.0:** Speed, accuracy, and intuitive UX  
- **2025 — AI Expansion:** New AI models and scalable automation patterns  
- **2026 — Axon Evidence Redesign:** Unified system design for multi-modal redaction  

This case study provides a concise overview of the work.  
In interviews, I share the full research insights, prototypes, and testing videos.

<Section title="My Role">
As **Lead Product Designer**, I shaped the product's multi-year vision and delivered core functionality across AI, workflows, and user experience.

My responsibilities included:
- UX strategy and roadmap alignment  
- Research synthesis (50+ interviews & usability tests)  
- Interaction design for AI-assisted workflows  
- Prototyping and iterative validation with agencies  
- Redesign of the app on new Axon Evidence platform

This work required deep collaboration with PM, engineering, and research partners.
