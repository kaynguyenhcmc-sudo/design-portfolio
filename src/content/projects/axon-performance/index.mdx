<Section title="Overview">
This AI-assisted platform transforms how supervisors review officer-recorded video. By integrating sentiment detection and data dashboards, the system identifies critical moments for performance assessment, training intervention, and commendation.
</Section>

<Section title="My Role">
- Led UX design for the Performance application, enabling supervisors to review officer-recorded video for performance assessment, training opportunities, and commendation.
- Led discovery research and validation using mockups and interactive prototypes to de-risk product direction before engineering investment.
- Designed data-driven dashboards summarizing sentiment trends, review coverage, and performance signals to help supervisors prioritize what to review and understand the "why" behind the data.
