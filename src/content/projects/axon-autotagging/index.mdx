<Section title="Overview">
AI Auto-Tagging analyzes multi-source signals (camera overlap, transcripts, dispatch data) to automatically suggest precise metadata across Axon App and Evidence. This drastically reduces manual data entry, enabling officers to quickly validate information and ensuring the completeness and reliability of every case file.

Prioritizing high-utility function over visual flair to support a user base of over 1 million officers.
