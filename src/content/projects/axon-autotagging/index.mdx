<Section title="Overview">
AI Auto-Tagging analyzes multi-source signals (camera overlap, transcripts, dispatch data) to automatically suggest precise metadata across Axon App and Evidence. This drastically reduces manual data entry, enabling officers to quickly validate information and ensuring the completeness and reliability of every case file.

Prioritizing high-utility function over visual flair to support a user base of over 1 million officers.
</Section>

<Section title="My Role">
- Led end-to-end UX for AI Auto-Tagging across mobile and desktop, driving the process from discovery to delivery to accelerate evidence retrieval.
- Designed "human-in-the-loop" workflows for reviewing and editing AI-generated metadata, effectively balancing automation speed with user control and trust.
- Collaborated cross-functionally with AI/ML and Engineering teams to align design decisions with model behaviors, technical constraints, and rollout plans.
